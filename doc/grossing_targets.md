(8)Projected estimates based upon the 2016-17 Survey of Personal Incomes using economic assumptions consistent with the OBR’s March 2019 economic and fiscal outlook.(9) Some UK taxpayers reside abroad, or region is not known (245,000 in 2016-17). The sum of taxpayer numbers across countries and regions in Table 2.2 therefore will not match UK total shown in Table 2.1.(10)From 2017-18, individuals who are classified as resident in Scotland and have total taxable income above the Scottish basic rate limit (BRL)but below the UK government’s BRL have their marginal rate classified based on their income within this notional band. For these taxpayers, non-savings non-dividend (NSND) income within this band is taxed at the higher rate, whereas savings and dividends income is taxed at the basic rate. A Scottish taxpayer with any taxable NSND income within this band (but no total taxable income above the UK BRL) is classified as a higher rate taxpayer, as this is the top rate they are paying. A Scottish taxpayer with only savings and/or dividend income within this band (and no total taxable income above the UK BRL) is classified as a basic rate taxpayer.(11) From 2018-19, individuals who are classified as resident in Scotland and have total taxable income in the Scottish starter rate or Scottish intermediate rate have their marginal rate classified based on their income within this notional band. For these taxpayers, non-savings non-dividend (NSND) income within these band is taxed at a 19% or 21% rate respectively, whereas savings and dividends income is taxed at the basic rate. A Scottish taxpayer with any taxable NSND income within these bands (but no total taxable income above the UK BRL) is classified as a basic rate taxpayer, as this is the top rate they are paying. A Scottish taxpayer with only savings and/or dividend income within this band (and no total taxable income above the UK BRL) is classified as a basic rate taxpayer.
